  <h1>Hello my name is Peyton.</h1>
  <p>A few of my favorite things:</p>
  <ul>I just finished my bachelor's degree in Social Studies Education, and I've worked call centers for the last few
    years from being on the phones, to managing, to training.</ul>
  <ul>I love the idea of programming and I want to become a well rounded and skilled developer and learn to do all kinds
    of cool shiz by turning lines of "gibberish" into dope websites. Be the best that I can be.</ul>
  <ul>My wife, my dog Toby, movies, and hockey.</ul>
  <p>Week Two</p>
  <ul>
    After two weeks, I'm definitely starting to see how difficult this is going to be. I'm still generally upbeat,
    confident,I enjoy learning and figuring this all out, but its's a STRUGGLE. This week I hit my first real moments of
    lack of comprehension (I'll probably need some tutoring time next week) with DOM stuff and the JS tests that they
    gave us. I understand the basic elements like writing loops and arrays and whatever else, and once I know what
    something is doing it's pretty locked into my mind, but putting it all together in the different apps we're doing is
    still another story.
  </ul>
  <ul>
    I think that if I can figure out the tests confidently, since that's some level of benchmark for our abilities, and
    do well with the checkpoints, I can be happy with where I'm at. Either way, I still love programming and even though
    it's easily one of the most difficult things I've ever done it's really fun to me and nothing beats finally figuring
    out the problem and overcoming what I didn't understand initially.
  </ul>
