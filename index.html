  <h1>Hello my name is Peyton.</h1>
  <p>A few of my favorite things:</p>
  <ul>I just finished my bachelor's degree in Social Studies Education, and I've worked call centers for the last few
    years from being on the phones, to managing, to training.</ul>
  <ul>I love the idea of programming and I want to become a well rounded and skilled developer and learn to do all kinds
    of cool shiz by turning lines of "gibberish" into dope websites. Be the best that I can be.</ul>
  <ul>My wife, my dog Toby, movies, and hockey.</ul>
